    "Q3>> Why do we use the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression?\n",

    "\n",
    "    For multiclass classification, a variant called Multinomial Logistic Regression is used.\n",
    " ### Independence of Observations\n",

    "\n",
    "    If data points are correlated (e.g., time series data or hierarchical data), methods like Generalized Estimating \n",

    " ### Which Solver Should You Use?\n",
    " #### For small datasets:\n",
    "\n",

    " ### Advantages\n",
    " ####  Simple & Easy to Implement:\n",
    "     Logistic Regression is straightforward and interpretable compared to complex models like Neural Networks.\n",
    " #### Fast Training & Prediction:\n",
    "     Training and inference are efficient, making it ideal for real-time applications.\n",
    " #### Works Well with Linearly Separable Data:\n",
    "     If the data is linearly separable, Logistic Regression can achieve high performance.\n",
    " #### Outputs Probabilities:\n",
    "     Unlike some classifiers, Logistic Regression provides probability estimates, useful for decision-making.\n",
    " #### Less Prone to Overfitting:\n",
    "     Regularization techniques (L1, L2, Elastic Net) help control overfitting.\n",
    " #### Robust to Small Datasets:\n",
    "     Unlike deep learning, Logistic Regression works well even with limited data.\n",
    " #### Feature Importance:\n",
    "     Coefficients give insights into the importance of each feature.\n",
    " ### Disadvantages\n",
    " #### Assumes Linearity:\n",
    "     Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds. Fails for highly non-linear data.\n",
    " #### Struggles with Large Feature Spaces:\n",
    "     High-dimensional data can lead to overfitting unless regularization is applied.\n",
    " #### Sensitive to Outliers:\n",
    "     Outliers can skew predictions since Logistic Regression is based on linear regression.\n",
    " #### Poor Performance on Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "     If one class dominates, Logistic Regression tends to predict the majority class more often.\n",
    " #### Requires Feature Engineering:\n",
